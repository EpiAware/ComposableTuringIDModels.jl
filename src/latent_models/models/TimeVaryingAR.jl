@doc raw"
A first-order autoregressive process whose damping coefficient varies over time.

```math
z_t = \rho_t\, z_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, \qquad t = 2, \ldots, n,
```

with the initial value ``z_1`` from the prior in `init`, innovations from the
error model `ϵ_t`, and — unlike [`AR`](@ref), whose coefficient is constant — a
whole coefficient *path* ``\rho_t``. That path is `transform` applied to a
length-`(n-1)` draw from the prior process `damp`.

This is the opt-in, genuinely time-varying counterpart of [`AR`](@ref): `AR`
applies its damping as a constant length-`p` coefficient (a process supplied to
its `damp` slot only enriches the *prior* over that constant), whereas
`TimeVaryingAR` threads a per-step ``\rho_t`` through the recursion. Because the
coefficient is a component you choose, any latent process — a [`RandomWalk`](@ref)
for a smooth path, an [`AR`](@ref) for a mean-reverting one — drops into `damp`.

`damp` is drawn on the unconstrained scale and mapped by `transform` (default
`tanh`, giving the stationary band ``(-1, 1)``; pass `identity` to opt out) so an
unbounded process such as a [`RandomWalk`](@ref) does not produce an explosive
recursion.

Identifiability note: a single series informs each ``\rho_t`` through one
transition, so recovering the whole path leans on the smoothness of the `damp`
prior; a panel of series sharing one ``\rho_t`` draw sharpens it.

## Fields

  - `damp`: prior process for the raw (pre-`transform`) coefficient path (a prior
    model or `Distribution`; default [`RandomWalk`](@ref)).
  - `init`: prior for the initial value ``z_1`` (a `Distribution` or prior model).
  - `ϵ_t`: error model for the innovations (default [`HierarchicalNormal`](@ref)).
  - `transform`: map from the raw path to the coefficient (default `tanh`).

Built with `as_turing_model(m, n)` it returns the numeric length-`n` path (like
every other latent model, so it drops straight into any latent slot — e.g. a
`Renewal`'s `rt` or a `DirectInfections`'s `Z`). The coefficient path ``\rho_t`` is
tracked as a generated quantity `ρ` (via `:=`), so it is recovered from the sampled
chain (`group(chain, :ρ)`) without changing the return contract.

# Examples
```@example TimeVaryingAR
using ComposableTuringIDModels, Distributions
tv = TimeVaryingAR()
length(as_turing_model(tv, 10)())
```
